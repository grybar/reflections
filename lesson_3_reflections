When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
You would want to do this when you are away from your own computer or using someone elses possibly.


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having git automatically stay up to date
with your remote repository?
You may want this because there may be some unwanted changes on the remote repository.

Describe the differences between forks, clones and branches. When would you use one instead of another.
fork: basically a clone that github makes for you. only present on github until you clone it to a 
computer. you would want to use this when you want a copy of someones work so that you could work on it 
yourself.

Clone: a copy of a repository from github that can now be edited on your own machine. You would want 
to use this when you don't want to make all your changes on github.

Branch: A branch is a different version of a project that can have different changes from other branches.
You would want to use this when making a new feature or testing something out.

What is that benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
So you know where you are locally in relation to the remote.

How would you collaborate without using git or github? what would be easier and what would be harder.
You could pass around one file at a time and make changes to it while you have the file.
This would take alot longer as only one person could work on a file at a time also you would have
a much harder time finding out what changes another person made.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits
does each approach have?
You would want to make changes almost always in a separate branch when collaborating with others because
if you did it could change code that others were relying upon. although it is slower to work on a 
separate branch.
