When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
You would want to do this when you are away from your own computer or using someone elses possibly.


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having git automatically stay up to date
with your remote repository?
You may want this because there may be some unwanted changes on the remote repository.
