What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
When you initialize a repository git makes an empty repository inside the folder your in.
You need to do this so there is a repository to work with.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value
do you think it offers?
The staging area is different from the repository because it is an area where a commit is 
created and then stored in the repository. It is different from the working directory because
the working directory contains what files can be put into the staging area. It is valueble
because that is where you can assemble commits with the files you want to be in the repository.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
You can by looking what files you have changed and create commits by picking out what changes should be
together.
